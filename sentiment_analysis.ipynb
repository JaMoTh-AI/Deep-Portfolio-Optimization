       " {'title': 'With 73% ownership of the shares, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is heavily dominated by institutional owners',\n",
       "  'content': \"Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Microsoft's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions A total of 25 investors have a majority stake in the company with 44% ownership  Insiders have sold recently  If you want to know who really controls Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 73% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute. In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Microsoft.  Check out our latest analysis for Microsoft  Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. We can see that Microsoft does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Microsoft, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Microsoft. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 9.0% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.3% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock. On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest. While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it. Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Microsoft Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.0b of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.  With a 27% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Microsoft. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Microsoft better, we need to consider many other factors.

The exact rebate will depend on the specifics of each transaction and will be previewed for you prior to submitting each trade. This rebate will be deducted from your cost to place the trade and will be reflected on your trade confirmation. Order flow rebates are not available for non-options transactions. To learn more, see our Fee Schedule, Order Flow Rebate FAQ, and Order Flow Rebate Program Terms & Conditions. Bonds.“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing. For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. High-Yield Cash Account.A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See here for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash. Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. Learn more. Alternative Assets.Brokerage services for alternative assets available on Public are offered by Dalmore Group, LLC (“Dalmore”), member of FINRA & SIPC. “Alternative assets,” as the term is used at Public, are equity securities that have been issued pursuant to Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended) (“Regulation A”). This content is not investment advice. These investments are speculative, involve substantial risks (including illiquidity and loss of principal), and are not FDIC or SIPC insured. Alternative Assets purchased on the Public platform are not held in a Public Investing brokerage account and are self-custodied by the purchaser. The issuers of these securities may be an affiliate of Public Investing, and Public Investing (or an affiliate) may earn fees when you purchase or sell Alternative Assets. For more information on risks and conflicts of interest, see these disclosures. An affiliate of Public may be “testing the waters” and considering making an offering of securities under Tier 2 of Regulation A. No money or other consideration is being solicited and, if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer to buy securities can be accepted, and no part of the purchase price can be received, until an offering statement filed with the SEC has been qualified by the SEC. Any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of acceptance given after the date of qualification by the SEC or as stated in the offering materials relating to an investment opportunity, as applicable. An indication of interest to purchase securities involves no obligation or commitment of any kind. Cryptocurrency.Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by SIPC. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a FINRA member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the Risk Disclosures before trading. Treasury Accounts.Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA & SIPC. See JSI’s FINRA BrokerCheck and Form CRS for further information.JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. See Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures for further details.Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value.

The stock’s poor performance this year is also attributed to higher inflation and monetary policy tightening. During over three decades since going public, the software producer has split its shares 10 times, with almost three decades since the latest stock split.\\xa0 Is it time for MSFT to follow other tech behemoths, including Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN), in diluting its shares, or is another Microsoft stock split less likely in the current macroeconomic environment? Microsoft is a Washington-based technology company and the world’s largest software maker. The company produces a wide range of products and offers services such as cloud computing, computer and gaming hardware, video games, and search engine. Some of its popular products include Microsoft Windows operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer web browser. The company went public on 13 March 1986. Microsoft offered 2.5 million shares at $21 a share – the price hit $35.50 before the end of the first trading session. The company raised $61m in its initial public offering (IPO). Microsoft's fiscal year is from 1 July to 30 June. Bullish Bearish 90% 10% You voted bullish. You voted bearish. Give MSFT a try Since its IPO in 1986, MSFT stock has produced returns of 75,962%, as of 3 November. The first major bull run was between 1997 and 1999 during the dotcom bubble, when the share price surged over 400% in two years. A crash, however, was imminent with MSFT reversing the gains and adjusting to a more sustainable growth pace.\\xa0 Over the last five years, the Microsoft stock price has risen 162%, as of 3 November, 2022, outperforming the Dow Jones (US30), S&P 500 (US500) and the tech-laden Nasdaq 100 (US100). The tech giant’s share price accelerated in 2020, when working-from-home boosted demand for Microsoft’s products. The stock surged 100% between March lows and the record high of $349.67 intraday, achieved on 20 November.\\xa0  It’s been a different story this year as investor sentiment has shifted towards risk-off amid fear of recession, aggressive monetary tightening to combat four-decade high inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. MSFT stock has fallen 31% year-to-date and 37% since the record high.\\xa0 Furthermore, the falling PC demand hit the tech giant along with other component makers including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA). Credit risk and research agency CreditSights noted:   AMC    NVDA    COIN    GME  According to tech research company Gartner, PC shipments declined 19.5% to 68 million units in the third quarter of 2022 on an annual basis. Mikako Kitagawa, director analyst at Gartner, said: Microsoft’s latest earnings report showed that the company's net income decreased 14% to $17.56bn in the three months ended 30 September, from $20.51bn a year earlier. The decline came as consumers spent more time outdoors rather than at home.\\xa0 In almost four decades since its listing, Microsoft has split its stock nine times, the last one carried out almost twenty years ago, on 14 February 2003. Out of the nine stock splits in Microsoft split history, seven were 2-for-1 and two were 3-for-2. 2:1 stock split on 18 September 1987 2:1 stock split on 12 April 1990 3:2 stock split on 12 June 1992 2:1 stock split on 20 May 1994 2:1 stock split on 6 December 1996 2:1 stock split on 20 February 1998 2:1 stock split on 26 March 1999 2:1 stock split on 14 February 2003 A stock split is when a company raises the number of its shares while reducing the price of an individual share. The action essentially does not affect the company’s market capitalisation, but the lower price can result in higher liquidity and raise investor enthusiasm. A split is typically carried out to make the stock more affordable to investors. For example, if a company's shares are valued at $100 and an investor has 100 shares, their total investment is worth $10,000. If the company then splits its stock by two, known as a 2-for-1 stock split, the investor will own 200 shares worth $50 each. The value of the investor’s holding will be unchanged. In 2022 alone, major US companies, including Amazon, Tesla (TSLA) and Google-parent firm Alphabet, carried massive stock splits in an attempt to make their shares more attractive for investors. Amazon and Alphabet, for example, split their stocks 20 for 1, meaning the shares became 20 times more affordable.\\xa0 This prompted some commentators to speculate that a MSFT stock split is likely in 2022, a bet that didn’t materialise as late as November.\\xa0 Taking into account the company’s stock performance, Violeta Todorova, senior research analyst at Leverage Shares, noted:\\xa0 Will Microsoft split its stock in the near future? We do not know. The share price is troubled amid a bearish market environment. A Microsoft stock split decision would be carried out by the firm’s executive team.\\xa0 Note that analysts can be wrong. Their forecasts shouldn’t be used as a substitute for your own research.\\xa0Always conduct your own due diligence before trading, looking at the latest news, a wide range of analyst commentary, technical and fundamental analysis on the stock. Keep in mind that past performance does not guarantee future returns. And never trade money that you cannot afford to lose. The last Microsoft stock split was carried out on 14 February, 2003. The 2 for 1 split led to a closing price of $24.96. To date, Microsoft stock has undergone nine stock splits. Although some investors expected a Microsoft stock split in 2022, the company has not announced one.

Still, its key to future success may hinge on its ability to remain at the forefront of the AI technology arms race. And if you look at just the past decade, Microsoft stocks have outperformed while it has transitioned to a cloud computing and subscription-based software model. Microsoft is the world’s largest software company and is best known for its Windows operating system. The company was founded by boyhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen in the mid-1970s. In the company’s early days, it focused on developing an operating system for IBM, releasing MS-DOS in 1981. By the early 1990s, Microsoft had sold more than 100 million copies of MS-DOS. The company released its groundbreaking Windows operating system in 1985, but Windows began gaining traction in the 1990s. With an initial public offering in 1986, MSFT’s IPO shares were priced at $21 per share and the company netted a valuation of $777 million. In fact, it was one of the best investments of the 1990s, reaching a peak market cap of around $600 billion during the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000. Shortly thereafter, a judge ruled Microsoft had violated U.S. antitrust laws by suppressing competition for its Internet Explorer web browser and ordered the breakup of Microsoft. Microsoft ultimately reached a settlement with the Department of Justice in 2001 to avoid that breakup. Over the next 20 years, Microsoft’s primary focus was shifting its business to a subscription model, investing heavily in its cloud services segment and expanding its presence in the gaming market. Along the way, Microsoft acquired the video collaboration application Skype in 2011, professional networking platform LinkedIn in 2016, game developer and publisher ZeniMax in 2020, cloud and AI software company Nuance Communications in 2021, and “Call of Duty” and “World of Warcraft” maker Activision Blizzard in 2022. Microsoft also invested $10 billion in OpenAI in early 2023. The company also made a big splash in the AI world in 2019 when it invested $1 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and secured a deal with OpenAI for Azure. Microsoft announced an additional $10 billion investment in OpenAI in January 2023 and integrated OpenAI technology into its Bing search engine roughly a month later. Related: Best online brokers. Since Microsoft went public, MSFT has split its stock nine times. The stock was added to the S&P 500 in 1994. On a split-adjusted basis, Microsoft’s stock price climbed as high as $59.97 in December 1999 during the dot-com bubble. But it dropped back down to as low as $14.87 in 2009 during the Great Recession, and it took Microsoft more than 17 years to finally make it back to its dot-com bubble highs in 2017. Since then, the stock has been on a tear. Microsoft shares reached nearly $350 in late 2021 before the 2022 tech sector sell-off dropped its stock price to under $215 in 2022. After gaining over 50% year to date in 2023, Microsoft hit a split-adjusted high of $371.65 on Nov. 14. Microsoft’s most recent stock split was a 2-for-1 split in February 2003. If you crunch the numbers on all nine of the company’s stock splits, a single share of Microsoft’s IPO stock would represent 288 shares of today’s Microsoft stock. Microsoft’s stock has performed very well since its 1986 IPO. In the past 30 years, Microsoft has generated a total return of more than 23,000%. Since the early 2000s, Microsoft shares have generated a nearly 900% return and investors have enjoyed a 1,050% gain over the past 10 years. Microsoft is well positioned to continue outperforming. But it also faces several potential stumbling blocks ahead. Public cloud computing is one of the largest growth markets in the tech world, and Microsoft’s Azure is a leading provider of enterprise cloud services. The company’s Microsoft 365 productivity software suite creates upselling opportunities and generates tremendous cash flow that the company can invest in Azure and other growth initiatives. Finally, a ChatGPT service is now on the market as ChatGPT Azure OpenAI Service. Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI could give the company a critical first-mover advantage in AI technology. Unfortunately, Microsoft Office is a mature product and likely has limited growth opportunities moving forward. Microsoft also needs a major presence in the key mobile device market and will continue to face intense cloud services competition from Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and other tech companies. Developing AI technology is expensive, and Microsoft risks falling behind Google’s Bard AI and other AI technology leaders if it doesn’t stay on the cutting edge of AI development. Analysts are generally optimistic about Microsoft’s business and stock price in 2024. The analysts covering Microsoft are projecting full-year adjusted earnings per share of $11.24 in fiscal 2024. That’s up from an earnings per share of $9.81 in fiscal 2023. Microsoft analysts are also calling for $243.21 billion in revenue for Microsoft in fiscal 2024, up more than 14% year over year. Microsoft’s fiscal 2024 already looks rosy. The company reported 27% net income growth in its fiscal first quarter. Azure cloud revenue growth accelerated to 29% in the quarter, and Microsoft guided for 15% in the second quarter. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss said Microsoft investors should expect the company to roll out more generative AI products in the coming months. “Accelerating revenue growth, (operating) margins up 465 (basis points year over year in the fiscal first quarter) and 27% year-over-year EPS growth amidst a still volatile IT spending environment well illustrates Microsoft’s differentiated position. Trading at 25 times our (fiscal 2025 EPS estimate) with the Gen AI innovation wave just getting started, MSFT remains our top pick,” Weiss said in an Oct. 25 Morgan Stanley report. Morgan Stanley has an “overweight” rating and $415 price target for MSFT stock. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said Microsoft’s generative AI opportunities and its ongoing transition to a cloud-based business model have the company positioned well for 2024. “We believe that MSFT will reap greater scale efficiencies through cloud adoption and see the Activision deal unlocking new growth potential in gaming,” Zino said in a Nov. 4 CFRA report. CFRA has a “strong buy” rating and $407 price target for Microsoft. The 43 analysts covering MSFT stock have a median price target of $410, suggesting double-digit upside over the next 12 months. But investors should always conduct their research before making important investment decisions. The biggest wildcard for Microsoft investors in the next several years. Microsoft is off to a strong start with its initial wave of AI product launches and its investment in OpenAI. But Microsoft’s 2023 stock rally suggests the market is already pricing in a high degree of AI success for Microsoft, and the stock’s momentum will likely only continue in the long term if it can live up to those AI expectations. Investors should also watch in the coming years to see how Microsoft plans to integrate Activision Blizzard into its existing gaming business and what the company’s long-term strategy will be for gaming moving forward. Zino said investors should expect Microsoft’s AI revenue growth to accelerate over the next two years as it rolls out additional AI-based productivity tools. “We see a slew of diverse ways that MSFT will be able to monetize the explosion of generative AI (e.g., cloud, CoPilot integration, OpenAI, Search expansion), driving considerable upside potential to our/street consensus views looking ahead,” Zino said. Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said Microsoft is a clear early leader in AI technology, but he sees limited valuation upside for the stock at current levels. “We see results as reinforcing our long-term thesis centering on the proliferation of hybrid cloud environments and Azure, as the firm continues to use its on-premises dominance to allow clients to move to the cloud at their own pace,” Romanoff said in an Oct. 25 Morningstar report. “Azure also is an excellent launching point for secular trends in AI, business intelligence and (the) Internet of Things, as it continues to launch new services centered around these broad themes,” Romanoff said. Morningstar has a “neutral” rating and $370 fair value estimate for Microsoft. Past performance does not guarantee future results, but Microsoft’s stock has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term since its IPO in 1986. There are currently 48 Wall Street analysts with “buy” or “outperform” ratings for Microsoft and none with “sell” or “underperform” ratings.  The highest closing price for Microsoft (MSFT) was $369.67 on Nov. 10.  The median 12-month price target among the Wall Street analysts covering MSFT stock is $410, suggesting double-digit upside for the stock through November 2024. Microsoft’s ability to reach and exceed that consensus valuation target will largely depend on whether the company can meet market expectations for AI technology, revenue growth and profitability. \\n\\t\\t\\tBlueprint is an independent publisher and comparison service, not an investment advisor.

It might be time. Since last year, some great technology stocks have run wild on the market's enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI). For example, Microsoft (MSFT -0.49%) has spiked to over $400 per share, which makes it harder for individual investors to accumulate shares for their portfolios. Not many people are sitting on thousands of dollars to buy shares. That puts the company on watch for a possible stock split. Companies splitting their stock is a common practice that can benefit investors and employees. But investors must know about some important rules for stock splits. Here is why Microsoft could split its stock and what you need to know if it happens. Stock splits aren't just for fun; they do good things for investors and company employees. For investors, a high share price makes accumulating full shares harder. Many companies issue stock to employees as part of their compensation. A high share price can make it harder for employees to control how they liquidate their stock. Splitting the stock lowers the share price, lessening this problem for buyers and sellers alike. Microsoft has split its stock many times before, but all of its splits happened many years ago. The stock split nine times from the late 1980s to the early 2000s but hasn't split once since then. As you can see below, the share price has now appreciated many times over:  MSFT data by YCharts The company launched Azure and the cloud computing age in 2010, and 2023 potentially marks the beginning of Microsoft's next golden age, artificial intelligence (AI). A split would help investors and employees position themselves for what seems like a very bright future. Investors' biggest mistake with stock splits is associating a lower share price with a cheaper valuation. Remember that price and valuation aren't the same. In other words, investors are paying a certain amount for a piece of the underlying company's profits. Splitting the stock cuts the company into more pieces but those pieces each represent less of the company's profits. Analysts believe Microsoft will earn $11.60 per share this fiscal year, which, for Microsoft, ends in June. Suppose Microsoft announces a 10-for-1 split, meaning that one share of stock will turn into 10 smaller shares. For a $400 stock, that's 10 shares priced at $40 each. Microsoft's profits would also be split 10 ways, meaning earnings per share would be $1.16. The stock's P/E ratio would remain the same because $400 divided by $11.16 and $40 divided by $1.16 get the same answer: 34.5. You shouldn't buy a stock based on whether or not it splits, because it doesn't impact how much bang you're getting for your buck. Instead, consider comparing Microsoft's valuation with what its growth might look like. Today, Microsoft's P/E ratio is roughly 35, and analysts expect the company's earnings to grow by an average of 15% annually over the long term. That's a PEG ratio of 2.3, which indicates Microsoft is a bit expensive for the growth you might get (a PEG ratio of 1 indicates a fair price).  MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts It's not a science; the company might grow faster than expected (or slower), and the narrative may be different in hindsight. A long-term horizon always helps because it gives Microsoft more time to grow into and beyond the stock's valuation. Whether or not you buy Microsoft, make sure you're doing it based on fundamentals and not a possible stock split. Justin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

       "  'content': 'What you need to know when investing in Microsoft  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), one of the world’s biggest tech companies, sells personal computing devices, cloud systems and services, and software. Microsoft\\'s products also include business solution applications, productivity applications, and video games. The company has expanded its focus into artificial intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), mixed reality, and related innovations.\\n  Microsoft was founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen to develop software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer. Five years later, Gates and Allen were hired to provide the operating system for IBM’s first personal computer (PC), followed in 1985 by Microsoft’s launch of its now-ubiquitous Windows software product. In 1986, the company raised $61 million in an initial public offering (IPO) that some analysts referred to as “the deal of the year.” Microsoft\\'s IPO took place on March 13, 1986. By the late 1980s, Microsoft had become the world’s largest PC software company.\\n  The company is headquartered in Redmond, Wash. and has been led by Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Satya Nadella since 2014. Microsoft operates within the information technology sector and is primarily associated with the software industry. But the reality is that Microsoft sells products geared toward both consumers and businesses and competes in a broad range of industries. Its main competitors include Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), and Oracle Corp. (ORCL). Microsoft\\'s latest fiscal year (FY) was FY 2021, ended June 30, 2021. For FY 2021, the company reported $61.3 billion in net income on $168.1 billion in revenue. As of Oct. 13, 2021, Microsoft\\'s market capitalization is $2.2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\\n On May 10, 2021, The Wall Street Journal reported that officials at the U.S. Department of Defense were considering dropping Microsoft\\'s $10 billion cloud computing contract for the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) that was given to the company in 2019. Critics, including Amazon.com Inc. had argued that the Microsoft contract award was influenced by politics: that included then-President Donald Trump’s antagonism toward Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns, who personally owns the The Washington Post. On July 6, 2021, the Pentagon canceled Microsoft\\'s JEDI contract, which had faced legal challenges by both Amazon and Oracle. The Pentagon will instead pursue a deal with both Microsoft and Amazon, as well as potential additional cloud service providers. The Department of Defense will reportedly finalize a decision on which companies will be allowed to participate in the program by the end of October 2021. On Aug. 31, 2021, Microsoft announced that Windows 11, the first major upgrade in years and the latest version of its popular operating system, would become available on Oct. 5, 2021. The company says the system is faster and includes a redesign, new accessibility features, efficient input settings, a focus on hybrid work, and other features. The operating system is available as a free upgrade for eligible Windows 10 PCs. Windows 11 represents a shift from the company\\'s previous stance of only updating an earlier operating system. Some tech reviewers say Window 11 is only an incremental improvement, pointing out that it lacks Android-app compatibility and other \"game-changing features.\" On March 2, 2021, Microsoft announced that the company was facing a state-sponsored cybersecurity threat that they dubbed “Hafnium,” which was based out of China. Hafnium’s attacks targeted a company product called Microsoft Exchange Server, an email and calendar server product used by tens of thousands of customers. Microsoft released a series of patches for Microsoft Exchange Server. However, there was a major problem. If users incorrectly installed the patch, the patch did not fully update the correct files. Most worrisome, if that happened the user received no warning message that the patch wasn\\'t installed. Industry experts describe the Hafnium attacks as \"astronomical\" and \"crazy huge\" in their scope. Bloomberg reported that there are “at least 60,000 known victims globally.” In July 2021, the U.S. government and Western allies formally blamed China for the attack. The announcement was not accompanied by sanctions against the Chinese government. The U.S. Justice Department filed charges against four Chinese nationals who prosecutors said who were working with China\\'s Ministry of State Security in the cyberattack. Microsoft has split its stock 9 times: Microsoft on Dec. 9, 2021 will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.62 per share. As of July 26, 2021, Microsoft\\'s stock had 7,514,891,248 shares outstanding. Since February 2014, Satya Nadella has been the CEO of Microsoft. Nadella also is chairman.

       " {'title': 'Is Microsoft Stock a Buy, a Sell, or Fairly Valued After Earnings? | Morningstar',\n",
       "  'content': 'With strong revenue and earnings, here’s what we think of Microsoft stock. Microsoft MSFT released its third-quarter earnings report on April 25. Here’s Morningstar’s take for investors on the company’s latest earnings and its stock. Results were good overall, with meaningful upside to both revenue and earnings per share relative to our expectations. All segments were ahead, with More Personal Computing strongest relative to our model. Windows and Surface, which have been under severe pressure, still came in considerably better than expected. Bing is gaining share, leaving many to speculate that the OpenAI-based search engine is going to gain more meaningful share versus Google. Guidance for the June quarter was better than expected for revenue, with cloud storage service Azure at the top end. The results support the investment case that there is a long runway for Azure growth and that Microsoft’s wide moat remains as strong as ever. The early feedback on the use of OpenAI within Microsoft’s portfolio is new (if incremental) evidence suggesting the same. We view Microsoft as a core holding, and the company’s latest earnings support this. Our fair value estimate for Microsoft is $325 per share, which implies a fiscal 2023 enterprise value/sales multiple of 11 times, adjusted price/earnings multiple of 34 times, and a 3% free cash flow yield. We model a five-year compound annual growth rate for revenue of approximately 10%. We believe revenue growth will be driven by Azure, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Azure in particular is the most critical revenue driver over the next 10 years in our view, as hybrid office environments (where Microsoft excels) drive mass cloud adoption. Read more about Microsoft’s fair value estimate. For Microsoft overall, we assign a wide moat rating arising from switching costs, network effects, and cost advantages. We believe Microsoft’s different segments and products benefit from different moat sources. The Productivity and Business Processes segment includes Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. We assign the segment a wide moat rating based on high switching costs and network effects. We believe Microsoft 365 is protected by a wide moat driven by high switching costs and network effects. It accounts for about 26% of revenue and is growing in the low double digits. We believe LinkedIn’s narrow moat is supported by network effects. The website is respected as a professional networking tool, and its large user base attracts recruiters, advertisers, and further users. We do not see a disruptive network or software tool threatening LinkedIn over the next several years. Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment includes Windows Server, Azure, Enterprise Services, and Visual Studio. We assign the segment a wide moat rating based on high switching costs, network effects, and cost advantages. We believe high switching costs and cost advantages drive a wide moat for Azure. It is clearly the growth engine for the Intelligent Cloud segment and one of the critical products the “new” Microsoft will be built around. We estimate that revenue from Azure itself is a mid- to high-single-digit percentage of revenue, growing by more than 75% annually. Read more about Microsoft’s moat rating.  Microsoft faces various risks among its products and segments. High market share in the client-server architecture over the last 30 years means significant high-margin revenue is at risk, particularly in operating systems, office and productivity software, and servers. Microsoft is acquisitive, and while many of its small acquisitions fly under the radar, the company has had several high-profile flops, including Nokia and aQuantive. The LinkedIn acquisition was expensive but served a purpose, and we believe it’s working out well. We expect the 2022 acquisition of artificial intelligence company Nuance Communications to be digestible. But the recently announced Activision Blizzard acquisition is the company’s largest ever, and it might warrant more attention. The public cloud buildout is still in its early phases; Amazon Web Services has taken the market by storm, with Azure trailing, but the two are the clear leaders. While we do not see significant environmental, social, or governance risks, Microsoft faces strong competition for software engineers on the hiring front, along with risks arising from potential breaches in its data centers.

       " {'title': '\\n\\t\\t7 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 20 Years: May 2024 | InvestorPlace\\t',\n",
       "  'content': \" Legendary Stock Picker: “Forget Nvidia, Buy This Instead” Eric Fry will show you how “the next $1 trillion AI stock” could hand you up to 40 years of Nvidia gains in the coming months. \\n\\t\\t\\tPosition your portfolio for growth over the next two decades with these seven picks\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAdvertisement\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Source: undefined undefined / Getty Images They say the best time to invest was 20 years ago. And indeed, that’s not too long after the early 2000s recession bottomed out. You’d be sitting on 377% in gains if you invested in the overall market exactly 20 years back. But the second best time? Many would say the COVID trough, but I’d argue that it’s right now, if you know where to look. The investing landscape right now may be better than many think, for those looking for buy-and-hold opportunities in the market. Things are surely more fast-paced these days, but 20 years gives you the chance to make the most out of what is likely to come in the future. You’d have known 20 years back that the internet was going to be very big. Accordingly, we have a lot of promising tech that can be big in the next two decades—but we’ll be investing in them indirectly through big ‘no-brainer’ stocks to buy and hold, instead of startups that could fizzle away. Thus, without further ado, here are the seven stocks I’d put my money into if I were handed a crisp $10,000 bill (they actually exist – look it up)! Just when it seemed like\\xa0Microsoft’s\\xa0(NASDAQ:MSFT) influence in the cloud sector couldn’t expand any further, the company surpassed expectations once again. Azure revenue soared 23% this past quarter to eclipse $35.1 billion. And it’s worth noting that arguably the entire AI revolution up until now has been indirectly orchestrated by Microsoft.\\xa0OpenAI\\xa0would not be where it is right now without the billions it got from Microsoft. From foundational infrastructure to cutting-edge large language models, Microsoft is\\xa0clearly\\xa0leading the way. The data boom doesn’t seem to be cooling down either. Azure’s deals valued at more than $100 million increased by over 80%, while commitments over $10 million more than doubled year-over-year. It’s estimated that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are now using Azure and/or OpenAI. Yes, MSFT stock trades at 35-times forward earnings and a tech selloff means this stock would likely decline as well. But this is a solid pick if you are holding for 20 years. I have full trust in CEO Satya Nadella, so this is definitely one of the best long-term stocks to buy and hold, in my opinion. Taiwan Semiconductor\\xa0(NYSE:TSM) is the backbone of the semiconductor industry. Most semiconductor companies supply directly from Taiwan Semi. Many analysts think the stock deserves to trade lower than its fabless peers due to the “China threat” and on-shoring trends. However, this argument does not make sense to me since any impact on Taiwan Semi would surely hit fabless semiconductor companies much harder. Plus, Taiwan Semi is\\xa0investing $40 billion\\xa0in U.S. chip manufacturing. Its facility is expected to be operational in 2027 or 2028. The company’s financial metrics remain robust.\\xa0Gross margins exceeded 53%\\xa0while operating margins topped 42%. Revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, beating estimates on both earnings and revenue. I see more upside ahead, since the premium you’re paying now is historically not that high. While seasonal effects dampened smartphone demand slightly in the first quarter, TSMC has done well across all areas of its business. Advanced technological nodes remain in high demand, with 3nm and 5nm processors already accounting for a sizable 46% of wafer sales. Barring unexpected disruptions, this chip giant appears well-situated to sustain its major role in the industry. Notably, TSM stock also provides a 1.7% dividend yield. So, if you like income and you want semiconductor exposure, this is one of the top stocks to buy and hold. It’s hard to ever be bearish on\\xa0Berkshire Hathaway\\xa0(NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B). This company has historically outperformed the\\xa0S&P 500, and I think it is well-positioned to continue doing so. CEO Warren Buffett might be old right now and not have a right-hand man anymore. But even then, this company’s portfolio is very solid. Berkshire Hathaway partially acts like an ETF, but with massive flexibility. The company can pile cash or other assets into big private companies like\\xa0BNSF Railway, taking on such investment over the years. Its biggest holding,\\xa0Apple\\xa0(NASDAQ:AAPL), has not performed well compared to other Big Tech companies, but it hasn’t delivered terrible results either. I think once Apple gets its AI game on point, we should see even more bullishness spill over into Berkshire stock. Alphabet’s\\xa0(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) most recent quarterly results were very encouraging. Revenue\\xa0increased 15.4% year-over-year, totaling over $80.5 billion. This continues to show the company’s leading position in internet search as well as video sharing through YouTube. Revenue is also up significantly in the company’s cloud computing business. I really can’t see Google ever being dethroned. AI has not made a dent in Google’s search segment, and YouTube seems even stronger to me. You can make an alternative to Google, but you can’t replace the massive amount of content on YouTube. YouTube and cloud computing revenue combined are on track to exceed $100 billion annually by the end of the year, if current growth continues. Each of the company’s major business lines showed robust expansion. YouTube has restrictions on adblockers now which is helping power revenue higher. The company also beat both top and bottom-line estimates, a trend I expect to continue. Amazon\\xa0(NASDAQ:AMZN) recently reported another stellar quarterly performance. Revenue\\xa0increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, comfortably surpassing Wall Street projections. But an even bigger highlight was its operating income, which rebounded 221% to $15.3 billion. It seems all of Amazon’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs are paying off. I believe the stock can continue climbing if the stock’s premium holds up. Investments in new fulfillment centers in more local regions are proving valuable, with nearly 60% of Prime orders in major U.S. metropolitan areas now arriving either the same day or the next day. Plus, with $48.8 billion in free cash flow over the last twelve months, I see a lot more room for expansion. Amazon is much more than an e-commerce business after the cloud boom, so I have solid conviction in this diversified business for the next two decades. The market’s reaction to Big Blue’s numbers last quarter was a little puzzling to me. While their revenue came in just a smidge below estimates, I’d say the company’s performance was rock solid across some key areas that matter a lot more. The current pullback is likely due to investors taking profits instead of concerns about\\xa0IBM’s\\xa0(NYSE:IBM) core business. IBM has been turning the corner, and is now quickly shifting from a mature tech cash cow to a cloud + quantum computing and software play. Few on Wall Street might now associate IBM with cutting-edge tech yet, but I think that dynamic may change.\\xa0The HashiCorp acquisition\\xa0is going to accelerate the process. IBM is doubling down on its hybrid multi-approach. And since Hashi’s Terraform is the number one tool buildings use for their infrastructure codes, IBM’s getting a great way to help more businesses get started. I think the company’s recent move to link up with Red Hat makes a lot of sense too. Indeed, this deal makes IBM’s entire IT assistance collection stronger. CRISPR Therapeutics\\xa0(NASDAQ:CRSP) is by far the riskiest play on this list. If you’ve been reading my articles for a long time, you’d know I stay away from most biotech companies. However, CRISPR has been one of the rare exceptions. I’ve been bullish on the stock since 2022. CRSP stock hasn’t made big moves either way since, but if this\\xa0gene-editing tech\\xa0does become successful, you’ll be laughing your way to the bank in 20 years. The company currently has seven trials underway studying new treatments for cancer, autoimmune conditions, heart health issues, and diabetes. The company’s tech can solve a lot more problems than just these. The big reason why I’m bullish on this stock is the company’s $2.1 billion cash buffer. I’m confident this cash can last for many years into the future. Analysts seem bullish on CRSP stock over the near-term, too.

Read More Microsoft recently disclosed a significant investment in Open AI, the company behind the artificial intelligence (AI) program ChatGPT, with an AI-powered version of its Bing search engine launched in February 2023. Early trials delivered mixed results, with improved levels of user engagement accompanied by ‘chat’ responses that, in scenarios such as multiple consecutive questions, were “not necessarily helpful or in line with our [Microsoft’s] designed tone”. On 17 February, the firm said: “Very long chat sessions can confuse the underlying chat model in the new Bing. To address these issues, we have implemented some changes to help focus the chat sessions.\\xa0 \\xa0 “Starting today, the chat experience will be capped at 50 chat turns per day and 5 chat turns per session (a turn is a conversation exchange which contains both a user question and a reply from Bing).\\xa0 The firm’s share price edged down in the days after the launch of the AI Bing, with investors waiting to see how Microsoft will manage the chat-related teething problems. The latest batch of results point to these issues being largely resolved. Here are some things you may want to know about buying and selling Microsoft shares. Before buying shares in a company ask yourself why you’re taking that decision. Does the company have great future prospects with a share price that could go from strength-to-strength? Or is there takeover talk in the offing that could potentially drive up a company’s share price? Maybe the company you’ve identified is on a recovery mission and its share price is starting to recover from previous lows. Investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk. Currency exchange rates are constantly changing which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms. You could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin.  Stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges, and may have other tax implications, and may not provide the same, or any, regulatory protection as in the UK. Tax treatment depends on one’s individual circumstances and may be subject to future change. The content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, any form of tax advice. There are several steps to take once you’ve satisfied yourself about the reasons for buying shares in a particular company. 1) Open an account Whether you’re a seasoned share trader, or someone who is brand new to stock market-based investments, if you want to buy shares in Microsoft, you’ll need to open an account with a regulated brokerage. Stockbroking is a competitive market place nowadays and services for DIY investors come in a range of different guises – from online investing platforms run by some of the biggest names in financial services, to nimbler investment trading apps that work off your smartphone or tablet. Before opening an account, you may want to bear in mind the following: And before buying any shares it may be worth asking yourself these questions: Featured Partner 1 eToro Invest in global and local stocks with ZERO commission *Other fees apply.

Read More 2) Know where Microsoft is traded The ticker symbol for Microsoft is MSFT and the company is traded on the Nasdaq market in the US. Nasdaq’s trading hours are 2.30pm – 9pm (UK time) Monday to Friday.\\xa0\\xa0 You should be able to buy US shares through most brokerage accounts. Buying shares in US dollars incurs a foreign exchange fee (typically around 1%) unless you fund the purchase from a US dollar account.\\xa0 Investments in a currency other than sterling are exposed to currency exchange risk. Currency exchange rates are constantly changing, which may affect the value of the investment in sterling terms. You could lose money in sterling even if the stock price rises in the currency of origin. Stocks listed on overseas exchanges may be subject to additional dealing and exchange rate charges, and may have other tax implications, and may not provide the same, or any, regulatory protection as in the UK.  Most brokerages also charge a slightly higher transaction fee for buying US, rather than UK, shares although it’s worth comparing the fees charged by different brokers if you plan to trade US shares regularly. You will be asked to complete a W-8BEN form (valid for three years) which allows you to benefit from a reduction in withholding tax for qualifying US dividends and interest from 30% to 15%. Holding US shares also carries exposure to foreign exchange risk. If the pound strengthens against the dollar, your shares will be worth less in sterling (and vice versa). As with UK shares, any profit on US shares will be subject to capital gains tax (CGT), unless you hold the shares in an individual savings account (ISA), or self-invested personal pension (SIPP). Tax treatment depends on someone’s individual circumstances and may be subject to future change. The content of this article is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to be, nor does it constitute, and form of tax advice.  3) Do your research To find out more about Microsoft, consider going online and visiting the company’s investor relations page. 4) Decide your investment strategy People tend to invest in one of two ways: either with a lump sum purchase, or via smaller, steadier amounts over time. The latter method is often referred to as a means of ‘pound cost averaging’, a stock market hack which may help you pay less per share on average over time. Rather than waiting to build up a lump sum, it means an investor’s money is being put to use in the market straightaway. 5) Place an order Once you’re ready to buy shares in Microsoft, log in to your investing account or trading app. Type in the ticker symbol MSFT and the number of shares you want to buy, or the amount of money you’re prepared to invest. 6) Review Microsoft’s performance Whether your share portfolio is crammed full of companies or holds only a handful of stocks, it’s vital you monitor how each component is performing on a regular basis: monthly, quarterly, or annually. Doing this gives you the opportunity to review performance and ask if any adjustments to your holdings are required – to maintain the status quo, buy more stock, or sell existing shares.  If you’re pleased with the performance of your shares and want (hopefully) to take a profit, there will come a time when you’ll want to sell your holdings. To do so, log in to your investing platform, type in the ticker symbol and select the amount that you want to sell. Note that if you’ve made a substantial profit, you may be liable to pay CGT when you come to sell your holdings, especially if your shares were held outside of a tax-exempt wrapper such as an ISA. The CGT tax-free allowance for the tax year 2023-24 is £6,000, a significant reduction from the £12,300 that was allowed in the previous tax year. Note that the allowance is due to be lowered again, to £3,000, in 2024-25. Find out more here about CGT, rates and allowances.\\xa0 Investing directly in individual stocks can be an absorbing and, hopefully, profitable experience. It may also qualify you for shareholder perks specific to the company in question. However, investing directly in individual companies can leave you vulnerable to stock market volatility and unforeseen swings in share prices. That’s why financial experts recommend that most people invest in a diversified mix of asset classes and investment funds that hold hundreds, if not thousands, of company shares. Being a major component of the Nasdaq index, Microsoft is found in many funds incorporating a bias towards the US. Dividends are a distribution, usually in cash, generally paid by a company to its shareholders quarterly or half-yearly. Payments are usually met out of that year’s earnings. Companies aren’t obliged to pay a dividend, but may choose to do so for a number of reasons – as a gesture of a company’s support to its financial backer, for example, or as an incentive to shareholders to continue owning shares. Microsoft has declared a quarterly dividend worth $0.68 payable from 14 September 2023.  Yes, in the sense that you’d need to add funds using an appointed card to an existing online investing service or trading app before making the share trade from there. This will vary depending on the investment service/platform that an investor is using to trade. Broadly speaking, there are three main types of fee. First is a share trading fee that investors are charged by a platform each time they buy or sell shares. Note that some platforms charge no fee for this activity, while others may charge a flat fee of typically between £6 and £12. Second comes the platform fee which is typically levied as an annual fee charged for holding shares on a particular investing platform. Again, some providers impose no fee, others charge a flat fee, and some services charge a percentage, typically 0.25% to.0.45% per annum of the underlying portfolio. If you buy or sell shares denominated in a foreign currency, nearly all of the investing platforms charge a foreign exchange fee. Again, this will vary amongst providers, but tends to sit in a range from 0.5% to 1.5% per transaction.

       " {'title': \"Microsoft's Massive €4 Billion Investment In French Tech And A Stunning 9% Stock Recovery Could Propel Their Shares Towards $500 - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) - Benzinga\",\n",
       "  'content': \"Earlier this week, Microsoft Corp MSFT\\xa0revealed their ambitious plan to invest €4 billion in enhancing its Cloud and AI infrastructure across France. This move aligns with the French government’s “Choose France” summit, which aims to make France a leading financial hub in the European Union. Microsoft's investment will focus on several key areas. First, they plan to train over a million people, giving them the skills needed for the digital economy. Additionally, Microsoft aims to support around 2,500 startups in France by 2027. This initiative will boost the local tech ecosystem and show Microsoft’s commitment to nurturing future technologies. This announcement follows their previous €15 million investment in the Parisian AI startup Mistral AI, which highlights the company's dedication to advancing AI technologies and their confidence in the French tech industry. From a financial standpoint, Microsoft’s stock is showing strong signs of recovery. After a nearly 10% decline between March and April, with the stock price falling below $400, there has been a significant rebound back towards previous levels. The stock has recovered about 9%, climbing back above $400. So far in 2024, it has risen by 12%, continuing its long-term trend that started in 2009, with a growth of 2445%. The current momentum could drive the stock to exceed the all-time high of $430, set on March 21st. If it breaks this level, there is potential for it to rise further towards the $500 level, a key psychological resistance zone. After the closing bell on Friday, May 24, the stock closed at $423.08, trading down by 1.57. This article is from an unpaid external contributor.

       "  'content': 'Save up to 74% Subscribe to Kiplinger When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft has been an astounding buy-and-hold bet. Not too long ago, Microsoft (MSFT) stock\\'s glory days looked to be behind it as sales of desktop PCs slipped into a seemingly irreversible decline. Although the dot-com days of the 1990s minted many a \"Microsoft millionaire,\" the aftermath of the tech bust led Microsoft stock to trade mostly sideways for more than a decade. But the past 10 years have been nothing short of a renaissance for the tech giant. When CEO Satya Nadella ascended to the top job in 2014, he not only began instituting cultural changes, he transformed Microsoft\\'s core strategy too. Cloud computing and subscription-based services were in; the days of selling software licenses via physical compact disks were passé. That focus on enterprise customers and – most importantly – Microsoft\\'s shift to selling cloud-based services such as Azure and Office 365 have been an astounding success. Today, Microsoft is a dominant player in cloud computing and a leader in generative artificial intelligence (AI) – and MSFT\\'s returns prove it. Be a smarter, better informed investor. Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice on investing, taxes, retirement, personal finance and more - straight to your e-mail. Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Indeed, Microsoft stock has been so remunerative since Nadella took over that long-term investors might not even notice that dud decade-plus following the tech bust.\\xa0 Between January 1990 and December 2020, shares in Microsoft, which joined the Dow in 1999 at the height of the dot-com boom, generated a total return of 57,730%. The S&P 500\\'s total return came to a mere 1,950% over the same span. Along the way, Microsoft generated $1.91 trillion in wealth for shareholders, good for an annualized dollar-weighted return of 19.2%, according to Hendrik Bessembinder, professor of finance at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. Only Apple (AAPL) generated more wealth for shareholders over those three decades, making Microsoft one of the very best stocks of the past 30 years, per Bessembinder\\'s findings, which account for cash flows in and out of the business and other adjustments.  With Microsoft trading near all-time highs (making it the world\\'s most valuable publicly traded company), it seemed like a good time to see what $1,000 invested in Microsoft 20 years ago would be worth today. Have a look at the above chart and you see only market-matching returns until around 2015. Then MSFT takes off. Indeed, it took off so much that if you put a grand into Microsoft stock two decades ago, today it would be worth about $25,500. That\\'s good for an annualized total return (price change plus dividends) of 17.6%. The same amount invested in the S&P 500 20 years ago would theoretically be worth about $7,000 today, or 10.2% annualized. But wait, there\\'s more.\\xa0 Over its entire life as a publicly traded company, Microsoft has generated an annualized total return of 26%. The S&P 500\\'s total return comes to 10.4% annualized over the same span. Happily for Microsoft bulls, analysts very much expect shares to continue their market-smashing ways. Of the 57 analysts issuing opinions on Microsoft stock surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 41 call it a Strong Buy, 13 say Buy and three have it at Hold. That works out to a rare consensus recommendation of Strong Buy, making MSFT a top-rated name among Dow Jones stocks.

       " {'title': 'Have Insiders Sold Microsoft Shares Recently? - Simply Wall St News',\n",
       "  'content': \"      Stock Analysis  Some Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) shareholders may be a little concerned to see that the President & Vice Chairman, Bradford Smith, recently sold a substantial US$20m worth of stock at a price of US$411 per share.    However, that sale only accounted for 8.7% of their holding, so arguably it doesn't say much about their conviction.      See our latest analysis for Microsoft   In fact, the recent sale by Bradford Smith was the biggest sale of Microsoft shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records.     That means that an insider was selling shares at below the current price (US$414).  As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation.  However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal.   This single sale was just 8.7% of Bradford Smith's stake.      Microsoft insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.    The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year.  If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!   For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.   Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own.  Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term.   It's great to see that Microsoft insiders own 0.03% of the company, worth about US$1.0b.  This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.    Insiders haven't  bought Microsoft stock in the last three months, but there was some selling.     And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases.    On the plus side, Microsoft makes money, and is growing profits.    The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales.      So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.    Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Microsoft you should know about.     But note: Microsoft may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.  For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.

Dec 3, 2023  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 closed right at recent highs on Friday. The equally weighted S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 still have a way to go before nearing recent highs, however. The mega-cap stocks like Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft have been the huge outperformers this year which accounts to the divergence between cap weighted QQQ and equal weighted QQQE. Friday, though, finally showed some struggles for some of these mega-cap names even with the indices closing higher. \\xa0Microsoft (MSFT), one of the mega-cap leaders, was actually down with both the S&P 500 and QQQ sharply higher. Has the time arrived to begin to fade the rally in these red-hot names? Let’s take a look at Microsoft using the POWR Options process to see if the manic melt-up may be starting to stall in MSFT. POWR Options likes to use a combination of fundamental and technical analysis along with looking at implied volatility to uncover trade ideas that have a probabilistic edge. This fusion approach helps put the odds in your favor. No guarantee (this is trading, after all) but an edge. Let’s take a quick walk through the approach using Microsoft as an example. Valuation Microsoft stock is getting pricey once again on a valuation basis. Current Price/Sales (P/S) ratio now stands at the highest level this year and the highest since January 2022.  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 This even though the 10-year Treasury yield is still over 4% and the Fed Funds rate is at 5.25% to 5.5%. \\xa0Back in January 2022 (the last time MSFT carried such lofty multiples) the Federal Reserve hadn’t even begun to raise rates off zero and the 10-year yield was at just over 1.5%.  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 To me, such historic increases in interest rates should dampen valuation multiples in a significant way. Plus, a 2.78 trillion dollar market cap company like Microsoft carrying a nearly 13x P/S ratio is difficult to justify since growth rates will necessarily be lessened simply due to the law of large numbers. Technicals MSFT stock is also showing some weakness (finally) from a technical perspective. Shares are struggling to break past the $380 area. 9-day RSI reached an extreme at 80 but has since fallen back to 56. Bollinger Percent B exceeded 100 and is now at 61. MACD also reached an extreme but just generated a sell signal by going negative.\\xa0 A break below the 20-day moving average could lead to further downside as it has done in the past.  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 Implied Volatility Implied volatility (IV) is hovering at the lowest levels of the past year. This means option prices are cheap. A year ago, the 75-day at-the-money puts were trading at just over a 30 IV. Now the same 75-day at-the-money puts are trading at just a 23 IV.  \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 To put the puts in perspective, the MSFT $255 puts were priced at $13.10 on 12/4/2022 with MSFT stock at $255.02. Now, similar $375 puts are priced at $14.40 with MSFT stock at $374.51. So, the 75-day puts are only $1.30 higher now even though Microsoft stock is $120 points higher! The percentage cost of put protection-and put prices-has dropped considerably to say the least. From over 5% a year ago to under 4% now. This is the trade idea generation process we use on a daily basis for the POWR Options Portfolio. Combine fundamental, technical and implied volatility analysis in a fusion format. Investors and traders alike may want to look to buy puts on an overvalued and overbought MSFT stock. The stock price hasn’t ever been this expensive and the put prices this cheap in a very long time.

       "  'content': \"Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Carlos Arguelles Follow Geek Culture -- 2 Listen Share Holding my breath, I hit Refresh to get the latest MSFT stock price. $21.88. I cringed. It was official. I had just watched a million dollars of Microsoft stock options evaporate in a matter of months. In another browser tab, the news. Grim articles about the war on terror, the antitrust case, and yet one more hot software startup going under today. 2001 was the end of an era. 10,000 Microsoft employees became millionaires in the nineties. I was there early enough to feel the tail end of that. When I was hired in 1997, Microsoft was a vibrant place, full of some of the smartest software engineers in the world. The energy was everywhere. We worked 60–80 hours per week and loved it. I often slept in the office. Windows and Office were in the top of the world. I wrote several nostalgic stories in my blog about the good old days at Microsoft, like “Memories from working at Microsoft in the nineties”, “The night I pulled an all-nighter for Bill Gates” and “Bunnies and Bees, Patenting at Microsoft.” I was a kid, fresh out of school, just an entry level engineer (level 59). Nothing special about me. Yet in my first 18 months at Microsoft, I saw my initial grants of stock options rise over a million dollars, stock splitting twice (in 1998 and 1999), giving me just a little taste of what the previous generation of microsofties had. It was intoxicating. I had spent my entire life under the poverty line. Yet all of a sudden I was a millionaire on paper before my 23rd birthday. Heck, we were all millionaires on paper — anybody that had been hired before 1998 was a millionaire by 2000. That made it very easy to work intense hours with a smile. I bought myself a new convertible Porsche in cash, midnight blue with tan interior, drove it really fast, and got lots of speeding tickets. Life in the fast line. There was a fundamental piece of advice that I could have used when I joined Microsoft in the nineties. Unfortunately, that piece of advice wouldn’t come to me until a decade later, where, at an Amazon company meeting, I would hear Jeff Bezos say, “Look, when the stock is up 30 percent in a month, don’t feel 30 percent smarter. Because when the stock is down 30 percent in a month, it’s not going to feel so good to feel 30 percent dumber.” We could have used that mentoring back at Microsoft in the nineties, because we all let the stock price get to our heads. Three things happened in rapid succession that changed everything. First, Microsoft was sued by the government for being a monopoly. The trial was long, painful and detrimental to both the reputation of the company and our pride to be a part of it. We followed each embarrassing deposition cringing. In 2000, the court ordered Microsoft to be broken up. (After that though, in 2001, the DOJ dropped the lawsuit, so the entire ordeal amounted to a slap in the wrist). But the uncertainty hit the stock (and morale) hard. Second, the dot com bubble bust caused Microsoft to tighten up the belt, and the stock again was hit hard. All of a sudden, tech companies around us were going under, left and right, and investors were skittish. And thirdly, the 9/11/01 attacks created yet more uncertainty in the entire world. 2001 was a grim year. What the combination of those 3 things amounted to in terms of Microsoft was a complete stasis of the stock price — which would continue for a decade. I watched in horror as more than a million dollars of stock evaporated in a matter of months. Between the antitrust case, the dot com bust and 9/11, the stock ended up back to the exact same price that it was on my very first day at work. These weren’t RSUs, they were stock options. So once they went back to their strike price, they were worthless. I had “made” and “lost” a million dollars, in the course of three years. I had my base salary left. Microsoft was surprisingly stingy with base compensation in the nineties. They could get away with it because of their stock options. At level 59, I was making $50k/yr base, which, adjusted for inflation, maps to about $85k/yr today. According to levels.fyi, Microsoft pays $110k/yr base to a level 59 now so they’ve clearly upped their game (plus their yearly bonuses are 2x what they were in the nineties). But back then the stock options were so glorious that nobody cared what their salary was. When I received my offer from Microsoft, I didn’t negotiate salary, I negotiated stock. Base salary paid for food and rent, but stock options were there so that you could retire in your thirties. The software industry in the nineties was a crazy world. After its fall from grace in 2001, for the next decade, that stock would oscillate around twenty dollars per share, without gains. All of a sudden, when your income is a fraction of what it was the year before, your excitement to work 80-hour weeks diminishes a bit. You’re demoralized. The energy level went down significantly in the hallways of Redmond. Scarcity creates wars. Exhibit A: During the beginning of the covid19 pandemic in 2020, for some odd-reason, law-abiding Americans ended up in fist fights in supermarkets over toilet paper. Exhibit B: In 2001, at Microsoft, the new scarcity meant you found yourself competing ruthlessly against your peers for just a couple more thousand dollars in yearly bonuses. Budget was limited and if a colleague failed, there was more money for you. This attitude created turf wars, fiefdoms, and a culture of hoping your next-door neighbor failed, sometimes actively sabotaging their work. I literally had the guy that sat 3 doors down from me once tell me, “you’re my same level and at performance time, you’re my competition, I don’t want to collaborate with you because I need to beat you”. He was a horrible human being, but he wasn’t the only one that felt that way. In all fairness, a lot of this behavior was always present at Microsoft in the early days. But I think it was more dormant (or maybe I was just more naive), and the demise of the stock options was a trigger that made it surface in everyday life. A lot of the star engineers realized they could make a lot more money elsewhere, and they started to leave in droves. Microsoft did a few things to stop the brain drain. They bumped everybody’s base salary in one fell swoop one day (I think by 20%?). They adjusted the strike price of a lot of options that were underwater. Eventually they switched from stock options to RSUs. None of these things made a significant impact. The crazy days of the Microsoft stock options were gone. I continued to work with extremely smart and dedicated people. But the motivation, the energy, were not the same. And the culture became more toxic every day (this isn’t just me talking, even Microsoft’s current CEO, Satya, talks about this extensively in his book). It also showed in the mediocrity of the products that came up during that time. Windows Vista was an atrocity. Microsoft, the Goliath, entirely missed the Search revolution that Google, then the tiny David, seized. I stayed at Microsoft until 2009. How and why I finally left is a different story. I never did become an actual millionaire at Microsoft. I’m 45 and I’m still (happily) working (but at Google now), so nowhere near “retired in my thirties.” I did get a lot from my 11 years at Microsoft: I learned how to be an effective software engineer and how to work in large professional settings. I shipped products that millions of people used. And, I also met my wife at Microsoft. So, I’m thankful for the time I was there. My last day as a Microsoft employee, in March of 2009, I had one last act of defiance: I sold every single share of Microsoft stock I owned, as a vote of no-confidence for Steve Ballmer. Microsoft stock was $20 that day, exactly the same price it was on my hire date in 1997. Microsoft stock is $300 today (a 15x growth in a decade). Microsoft is one of the most valuable companies in the world with a 2.25 trillion market cap. Clearly do not seek advice from me when it comes to buying and selling stocks. I must say, I am delighted to see how Satya Nadella has turned Microsoft around. I did not think that was possible. I didn’t think anybody, let alone an insider, could turn the company around. Yet Microsoft today is an extremely dynamic, progressive company, with refreshing innovation. Kuddos to Satya for achieving the seemingly impossible. After I left Microsoft in 2009, I went on to work at Amazon until 2020 and loved it. In 2020, as I decided to leave Amazon, I did send my resume to Microsoft, and I went through a full loop (even got an offer!). I had to admit what prompted me to apply was morbid curiosity. In my head, Microsoft was still the dysfunctional place I left in 2009. But I had to at least give it a shot, because I loved the Microsoft of the nineties — lots of fond memories. Instead, when I came to Redmond in January of 2020 for an onsite, I found an entirely different culture. Not Bill’s Microsoft. Not Steve’s Microsoft. Satya’s Microsoft. I came to the Microsoft campus about two hours before my onsite. It was a frigid January morning in 2020. I grabbed a double tall latte to warm me up, and walked around the old places. I had spent 11 years there… I had lots of memories. Building 9, where my adventure had started in 1997, was gone. As was Building 4, where my adventure had ended in 2009. Microsoft was building much higher buildings to replace the humble 2-story original ones from the eighties, where I had personally seen Bill Gates’ helicopter land so many mornings, or park his Porsche. The parking lots weren’t full of Ferraris and Lamborghinis like in the nineties, but they did have some nice BMWs and Mercedes. I interviewed in Building 16, a building where I had worked for years. Having to wear a Visitor badge felt weird. I had so many mixed feelings that morning. I was open-minded and I had a surprisingly positive interview loop that day. The people I spoke to were fantastic. I could see myself working with them. It really did feel like an entirely different world. I was so intrigued that I ordered Satya Nadella’s book, “Hit Refresh: The Quest to Rediscover Microsoft’s Soul” (You may have noticed I started my story today with an anecdote of me hitting the Refresh button; that was a playful little secret nod to Satya’s book). I devoured it front-to-back. I cannot highlight enough how much of an accomplishment it was to change the culture of a 45-yr old company with hundreds of thousands of employees. I did end up getting an offer, and I strongly considered it, but working at Google was just too exciting to pass up, so that’s the direction I went. As I walked around Microsoft campus that frigid January 2020 morning taking small sips of my piping hot latte to warm me up, I felt nostalgic for a world I knew that no longer was. I am thankful to Microsoft for shaping me into being the person I am today, in so many ways. I reflected long and hard on how companies change over time, and the events, small or big, that cause culture to shift. Microsoft had a golden era, a dark era, and a rebirth. Nothing stays the same, but how you evolve matters. -- -- 2 Geek Culture Hi! I'm a Senior Principal Engineer (L8) at Amazon. In the last 26 years, I've worked at Google and Microsoft as well.
