You can also make a function that calls all of these at the same time and returns a dictionary containing all of these values (a dictionary of directories) with tickers as keys in the first dictionary and then ‘risk’, ‘price’, ‘expected_returns’, and ‘sector’ as keys in the second dictionary. All of these functions should also take in a data and a range to calculate data from so that we can calculate past data effectively.\n"
